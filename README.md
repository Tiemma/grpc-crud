## GRPC CRUD Microservice 

So I'm working on this as a simple long term project which would be implementing the following features:

 - API endpoints for interactivity using Flask
 - CRUD feature with events 
 - GRPC transport mechanism using Protobuf structs
 - A self configured load balancer using nginx
 - Caching using Varnish / Redis [I'd do both and benchmark]
 - A couple other stuff I'd add later as I think about stuff
 

### Why am I doing this?

I've been reading a lot of books such as the SRE handbook and Designing Distributed systems and as such,
I'm now implementing some of the cool features I read there from scratch.
